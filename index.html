        <h3>Welcome!</h3>
        <p>Hello! You are now viewing my Resumap. With a lot of help, and some research, I created this map to help outline my resume in a new and fun way for people to see. It will span across the country from a small town in Connecticut and ending in a large city in Oregon. If you'd like more information please do not hesistate to reach out and email me at <a href="mailto:jameslcarpino@gmail.com">JamesLCarpino@gmail.com</a> </p>

        <h3>Oakville, CT 1991-2009</h3>
        <p>This is where it all began. My parents moved to Oakville in 1991, a few months after I was born, and I used Connecticut as a homebase for all of the places my life and career would bring me in the coming years. My hometown is where I developed an interest in the visual arts, specifically in video, photography, and editing the recordings of my friends skateboarding in the streets and a multitude of private businesses' parking lots.</p>

        <h3>Central Connecticut State University, 2009-2013</h3>
        <p>Central was where I realized I could take my hobby of working with video and transform it into a career. I started out as a Biology major, but was unfulfilled and decided to take an unthreatening class called, "Introduction to Visual Arts" and was hooked. I changed my major from biology to communication and dove into a world of media production, journalism, and video art. I graduated in 2013, and while I was in school began an internship at Captured Time Productions.</p>

        <h3>Captured Time Productions Part 1, 2013-2016</h3>
        <p>I began working as an intern at Captured Time Productions in 2013. Come October of the same year I would be working as an editor and camera operator full time while finishing my degree. In the coming years I would work on countless films, edit more projects than I can really count, and worked my way up through the company. Along with working on an assortment of films ranging from empowering films to help learning disabled people to a film about upcoming opera stars. The film “One by One: The Teachings of Diana King” won a few awards for excellence in educational films. If you feel so inclined to learn about teaching practices for young children, you can watch the film in sections <a href="https://www.seedling.tv/videos/documentaries/?vimeography_gallery=18&vimeography_video=236585238"> here!</a></p>

        <h3>The Appalachian Trail, 2016</h3>
        <p>In 2015 while working for Captured Time I felt a twinge of an idea began to burrow into the back of my head. The idea was simple, “how far can I walk?” From there I spent the next year finishing every project I had on my plate, set up the company to be able to operate smoothly without me as a main editor, and planned a 6 month excursion into the backcountry of the east coast. On March 24, 2016 I began my hike. All together I traveled 2,189.2 miles of varying elevation gains and loses over 13 states, I lost 40 lbs, gained a new sense of self worth, and refreshed my creative eye. I finished on September 30, 2016. The trail changed my demeanor and approach on life. If you would like to view photos from this trip I encourage you to visit my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pine_foot"> instagram account!</a></p>

        <h3>Captured Time Productions Part 2, 2016-2017</h3>
        <p>Upon my return, I picked up pretty much where I left off. I started working as a consultant for a few days a week with Captured Times again on various projects. Before long I was back working full time with them as if I had never left. More filming, more projects, more traveling around the country with them. Most of the time was spent revisioning the company as a new hub for storytelling. I helped work to set the groundwork for a web based educational and holistic health storytelling hub. Projects of note during this time were a short film about a well known dyslexic accountant in New York City who desperately wanted to be able to play music but was hindered by his learning disability. You can view part 1 here! Another project of note was the beginning of a film called, “Waterbury.” this film began production in December 2016 during a blizzard. A day of shooting B roll of the city during a snowstorm that shut the whole state down was beginning to take shape into a film about the public schools in Waterbury, CT and how with limited resources they were able to give kids a worthwhile education due to the passion of the teachers there.</p>

        <h3>MAAPs Part 1, 2017</h3>
        <p>One day I woke up to a voicemail on my cell phone, it was my cousin asking me if I would be available for 2 months in the summer to help reinstate an old program of teaching young kids about hiking in the backcountry and the skills, manors, and knowledge to do so safely. Next thing I knew I was in my car, laptop and hard drives in my passenger seat, and I was on my way to Owls Head, NY about 25 miles from the Canadian border. We wrote a curriculum, and I began teaching children about the many things that go into being a shepherd of backcountry trails in the Adirondack mountains. I led backpacking trips of 10-16 year old kids on excursions in the western high peaks. Notable mountain climbed were Mt. Colden, Marcy, and Algonquin. Always taking the kids through Avalanche pass, a challenging 2 mile stretch of scrambling rocks through a valley between two sets of 4,000ft mountains. All the while I was leading these trips, I was also working from my laptop to help Captured time move forward with projects such as a film that was started back in 2015 about an elite educator named Louisa Moats. I spent my summer split between pouring over transcripts of interviews and educating children on backcountry practices. This film is still in production today.</p>

        <h3>The Long Trail, 2017</h3>
        <p>What’s a hiker to do so close to the Canadian border? Well he hikes home of course! And that is exactly what I did. After working for the 2 months in the summer in the Adirondacks I was dropped off in Jay State Forest in Vermont. I hiked a few miles north and crossed the Canadian border, and met up with the trailhead for the Long Trail, the oldest footpath in America. Over the next 3 weeks I walked to Massachusetts to complete my second long trek. Altogether the trail was a 273 miles long muddy adventure, significantly shorter than the Appalachian trail, but equally as challenging. Most of the time I was soaked from rain and alone sleeping in lean-tos and ski mountain warming huts. I finished the hike on September 18, 2017.</p>

        <h3>Captured Time Productions Part 3, 2017-2018</h3>
        <p>Back from hiking and ready to get back to the office yet again, I picked back up where I left off at Captured Time. We worked diligently to shoot and edit for the entire year for the “Waterbury” film and it was beginning to take shape. Now you can view the first few teaser episodes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldKaYMJE4D0"> here</a>. The company was restructuring and it was also rebranded to become the web based storytelling hub we started creating back in 2016. Seedling.tv, was born and content was starting to populate the site. Content ranging from long form documentaries to short form profiles as well as presentations from keynote speakers at varying conferences focusing on education, heirloom food, and farming. More traveling, more editing, and more projects were being started everything was and is moving forward for the company. Then I decided that I was ready to move on. I had been there for 5 years at this point, and I wanted to change my location. In June of 2018 I officially left Captured Time Productions to fulfil new ambitions and goals. I had my eyes and mind set on moving to Portland Oregon.</p>

        <h3>MAAPs Part 2, 2018</h3>
        <p>I returned back to Owls Head NY for the summer before heading across the country to Portland. I worked here another summer doing much of the same as the previous time. I was leading backpacking trips. We did new routes, some of the same routes, and all together this year cemented the curriculum into the framework of the camp and I felt comfortable calling this my last summer working for them as I had confidence that someone younger would take my place as the director of this program. Most of the time, when I wasn’t leading backpacking trips, I was planning my personal trip to the west coast as well as still consulting with Captured Time sparingly.</p>

        <h3>Bicycle Tour, 2018</h3>
        <p>How do you uproot your life in the most spectacular way? Well, for me it was the decision to do something I’ve never done before in sync with another thing I’ve never done before. The two things I’m speaking of are 1. Go to the pacific northwest and 2. Go on a bike tour for thousands of miles. I’m no stranger to the long distance grind of a self propelled trip, but as far as biking goes I’d never done a long distance trip. I mounted my bike on August 24, 2018 and left from Yorktown, Virginia to travel the Trans American Bike Route to Astoria, Oregon. Those who are smarter than me will say, “That is awful late in the season to bike through the Rockies,” and they would be very correct to say that. The trip was my 3rd long distance adventure and also my 1st unsuccessful one. I made it 1750 miles to a town named Hutchinson, Kansas where after a week of storms the roads out of town were flooded, and it began to snow in Kansas. I was forced to realize the unfortunate truth that the Rockies were not fit for traveling through by bicycle. I dismantled my bike, packed it up, and mailed my bike and belongings ahead of me to Portland. I boarded a train at 3:30am and traveled to Los Angeles, California for a few days. From there I boarded a second train that took me north up the coast to my final destination.</p>

        <h3>Portland, OR, 2018-</h3>
        <p>That’s it, this is where I am now! I am currently employed at Mapbox now! Who'd of thought this small resume map project would have lead to me learning how to actually use their product well enough that they'd hire me. Go figure, life is funny that way.</p>
